Predicting virtual currency values in a virtual gaming environment has rarely been explored; it is difficult to apply real-world methods for predicting fluctuating currency values or shares to the virtual gaming world on account of differences in domains between the two worlds. To address this issue, we herein predict virtual currency value fluctuations by collecting user opinion data from a virtual community and analyzing user sentiments or emotions from the opinion data. The proposed method is straightforward and applicable to predicting virtual currencies as well as to gaming environments, including MMORPGs. We test the proposed method using large-scale MMORPGs and demonstrate that virtual currencies can be effectively and efficiently predicted with it.",8/4/2015,2/5/2023 8:19,2/5/2023 11:08,2/5/2023 8:19,e0132944,,8,10,,PLoS ONE,,,,,,,,en,,,,,DOI.org (Crossref),,,,C:\Users\colde\Zotero\storage\A4R6Q9BB\Kim et al. - 2015 - Virtual World Currency Value Fluctuation Predictio.pdf,,,,"Zhou, Wei-Xing",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The objective of this paper is to determine the predictable price direction of Bitcoin in USD by machine learning techniques and sentiment analysis. Twitter and Reddit have attracted a great deal of attention from researchers to study public sentiment. We have applied sentiment analysis and supervised machine learning principles to the extracted tweets from Twitter and Reddit posts, and we analyze the correlation between bitcoin price movements and sentiments in tweets. We explored several algorithms of machine learning using supervised learning to develop a prediction model and provide informative analysis of future market prices. Due to the difficulty of evaluating the exact nature of a Time Series(ARIMA) model, it is often very difficult to produce appropriate forecasts. Then we continue to implement Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) with long short-term memory cells (LSTM). Thus, we analyzed the time series model prediction of bitcoin prices with greater efficiency using long short-term memory (LSTM) techniques and compared the predictability of bitcoin price and sentiment analysis of bitcoin tweets to the standard method (ARIMA). The RMSE (Root-mean-square error) of LSTM are 198.448 (single feature) and 197.515 (multi-feature) whereas the ARIMA model RMSE is 209.263 which shows that LSTM with multi feature shows the more accurate result.",6/18/2020,2/5/2023 8:21,2/5/2023 8:21,2/5/2023 8:21,,,,,,,,,,,,arXiv,,,,,,,arXiv.org,,"arXiv:2006.14473 [cs, q-fin]",,C:\Users\colde\Zotero\storage\G75CGJUW\Raju and Tarif - 2020 - Real-Time Prediction of BITCOIN Price using Machin.pdf; C:\Users\colde\Zotero\storage\SUQ3VX6Q\2006.html,,,"68T07, 68T09, 68T50; Computer Science - Machine Learning; Quantitative Finance - Statistical Finance",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,arXiv:2006.14473,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We confirm that finetuning using weak labels enhances the predictive value of text-based features and raises forecast accuracy in the context of predicting cryptocurrency returns.

Bitcoin and Ethereum, the two largest cryptocurrencies in terms of market capitalization represent over $160 billion dollars in combined value. However, both Bitcoin and Ethereum have experienced signiﬁcant price swings on both daily and long term valuations. Twitter is increasingly used as a news source inﬂuencing purchase decisions by informing users of the currency and its increasing popularity. As a result, quickly understanding the impact of tweets on price direction can provide a purchasing and selling advantage to a cryptocurrency user or a trader. By analyzing tweets, we found that tweet volume, rather than tweet sentiment (which is invariably overall positive regardless of price direction), is a predictor of price direction. By utilizing a linear model that takes as input tweets and Google Trends data, we were able to accurately predict the direction of price changes. By utilizing this model, a person is able to make better informed purchase and selling decisions related to Bitcoin and Ethereum.",2018,2/5/2023 8:25,2/5/2023 8:25,,,,3,1,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,Zotero,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Does this also apply to societies at large, i.e. can societies experience mood states that affect their collective decision making? By extension is the public mood correlated or even predictive of economic indicators? Here we investigate whether measurements of collective mood states derived from large-scale Twitter feeds are correlated to the value of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) over time. We analyze the text content of daily Twitter feeds by two mood tracking tools, namely OpinionFinder that measures positive vs. negative mood and Google-Profile of Mood States (GPOMS) that measures mood in terms of 6 dimensions (Calm, Alert, Sure, Vital, Kind, and Happy). We cross-validate the resulting mood time series by comparing their ability to detect the public's response to the presidential election and Thanksgiving day in 2008. A Granger causality analysis and a Self-Organizing Fuzzy Neural Network are then used to investigate the hypothesis that public mood states, as measured by the OpinionFinder and GPOMS mood time series, are predictive of changes in DJIA closing values. Our results indicate that the accuracy of DJIA predictions can be significantly improved by the inclusion of specific public mood dimensions but not others. We find an accuracy of 86.7% in predicting the daily up and down changes in the closing values of the DJIA and a reduction of the Mean Average Percentage Error (MAPE) by more than 6%.",3/1/2011,2/5/2023 8:30,2/5/2023 8:30,2/5/2023 8:30,8-Jan,,1,2,,Journal of Computational Science,,,,,,,,en,,,,,ScienceDirect,,,,C:\Users\colde\Zotero\storage\BKN9B8QY\Bollen et al. - 2011 - Twitter mood predicts the stock market.pdf,,,Collective mood; Sentiment tracking; Social networks; Stock market,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, the vector autoregressive volatility forecast, coupled with a parametric lognormal–normal mixture distribution produces well–calibrated density forecasts of future returns, and correspondingly accurate quantile predictions.

For the Multi-Class Sentiment Analysis, a Random Forest model is chosen after manually labelling a dataset of 1500 tweets and training as well as evaluating multiple supervised learning models. The Random Forest model achieves a classification accuracy of almost 90% on the test set of our manually labelled data. The Interval Classification leverages an existing lexical resource (SentiWordNet) and its thresholded values reaches an accuracy of 60% on our labelled data. Both Sentiment Analysis approaches are further processed and then compared to the financial performance of the respective cryptocurrencies. A lead-lag analysis is performed by means of lagged cross-correlation evaluation and the Thermal Optimal Path (TOP) method. It is concluded that the lead-lag dynamic between social sentiment and financial performance is timevarying and not equal for all cryptocurrencies. While more main-stream coins like Bitcoin (BTC) and Etherium (ETH) show similarities, smaller altcoins like Ripple (XRP) seem to have a more constant lead-lag dynamic where social media sentiment is leading and market performance is lagging behind. The computer ran Ubuntu 16.04 with the NVIDIA CUDA and cuDNN libraries installed to take advantage of the GPU. As the primary programming language Python was chosen due to its simple syntax and popularity in the deep learning field. The code was briefly tested with Python as well and seemed to work.
